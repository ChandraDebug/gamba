        <p class="lead ">
            The grass is currently spread in vast areas of NT and other parts . To effectively control the grass, one of the effective ways is for people to report it.
            We call it crowd controlling (similar to crowd-funding).

            To apply that solution we will need to find effective ways for common people to identify the grass correctly and then report it.

            Our solution is to use AI and build that in an app , which people can use to identify and report it. The users will take a picture or real time video and then through Object detection AI , we will infer if it is gamba grass

<br >

            We have built and trained an AI model using the gamba grass pictures to accurately (or almost accurately) detect the grass.

            <h2 class="display-5">How to use</h2>

            <ul class="lead">
             <li>
                 Upload an image of gamba grass which you have take by your camera
             </li>
             <li>
                 Click on the inference button to trigger the AI model to detect if there is any gamba graa in there

             </li>

             <p>Please note that due to limited time and resources available , the model is not 100% accurate
             </p>
